<h3> Crossword Mysteries : Riddle me dead</h3>
<p> This movie keeps you on the edge as to who is the murder.The least expected person or the person who nobody espects to the murder is the murder. Crosswords as used to solve the mystery.</p>
<h3> Hailey Dean Mysteries : A Will To Kill</h3> 
<p> I love this movie because the unexpected person is the killer. Hailey trusted her long time friend named Cylde. They worked together to find out who killed her fiance and in conjuction they also investigated the missing girl whose name is Emma. In searching for the missing girl she finds out that she was the target of the killer not her fiance. At the end the unexpected happens.</p>
<h3>Step up : All In</h3>
<p> In this  one I love the way the dance.  when the team was up against their revials they step up to show the creative in the form of dance. People are taken from streets and given home because of their talent. I love how they care for each other even when the don't come from same backgrounds or coming from the same parents. </p>
